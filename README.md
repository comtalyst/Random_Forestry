# Random_Forestry
The technical objective of the project is to find and select "useful" features from the mass amount of predictable training data using Random Forest.<br>
Used RandomForestClassifer from scikit-learn to process and pickle to store the model.<br>

Immunotherapy.xlsx -- the dataset example<br>
modelBest.pickle -- best models acheived from the dataset after multiple (randomized) runs<br>

This project is part of the Independent Study in Advanced Programming course at George School.<br>

Note that the codes have been kept in the original form at the time of submission.
